## Sarcasm Detection ##

This Jupyter notebook, Sarcasm_Detection (5).ipynb, is a Python script for detecting sarcasm in text data. 
It uses various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, natural language processing, and machine learning.

### Libraries Used ###
* Data Manipulation: numpy, pandas
* Data Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, wordcloud
* Natural Language Processing: nltk, bs4, re, string, unicodedata, keras.preprocessing.text, sklearn.feature_extraction.text
* Machine Learning: sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.tree, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.neural_network, sklearn.naive_bayes, sklearn.svm, sklearn.pipeline, keras.models, kerab.layers, tensorflow
* Other: tqdm


### Functionality ###
The script uses various machine learning models and techniques for sarcasm detection, including:
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Neighbors Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Classifier
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Random Forest Classifier
* SVC (Support Vector Classification)
* Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
  
The text data is processed using techniques like tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

### Usage ###
To use this script, you will need a dataset containing text data labeled for sarcasm. The script will train the various models on this data and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
